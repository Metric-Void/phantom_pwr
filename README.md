#Phantom Power Supply
## Description
This is a standalone power supply for phantom power microphones. 48V Phantom power is "injected" into the wire to power the microphone, and the output can be directly sent to computers, phones, etc.

Power supply range is 12V-19V by design. Voltages close to this may work, but not guaranteed. The DC-DC converter circuit is designed to output 0.5A, well above the requirement for a single microphone. The circuit can be expanded to supply more microphones.

## Usage
This project is designed with Autodesk EAGLE PCB. Free versions would be enough since it have only one schematic and one board. Simply clone into your Documents/EAGLE/projects folder, and open the epf file.

The completed circuit board should be placed in a shielded, metal enclosure to prevent noise.
